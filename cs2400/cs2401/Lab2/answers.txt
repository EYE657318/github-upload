SSC2401 Summer Lab 2 Answer Sheet
Name: Isaac Phillips


1.) Nothing, it closes automatically
When making that not happen, this is the result:
2 4 6 8 10 12 14
2 4 6 5 10 15 14 Total bytes allocated = 60
Enter any character to exit.

2.)
The original array has been edited, replacing 8, 10, and 12, though N2 has properly removed the 14.

3.)
The addresses for N1 and N2 are the same. Not sure why, but replacing 'N1 = N2' with another way of entering numbers solves the problem, so I assume that has something to do with it.

4.)
Now the arrays are actually different from eachother, and correct. 

5.)
Yes

6.)
The address isn't copied over in our overloaded assignment.

7.)
0xa78c78
0xa7a028
0xa7b3d8
0xa7c788
0xa7db38

8.)
Ignore ones digit since they're all 8
a is two higher than 8
0 is 12 lower than c
2 is five lower than 7

200 - 120 - 7 = 73
730

9.)
0x708c78
Get out >:(
0x70a028
Get out >:(
0x70b3d8
Get out >:(
0x70c788
Get out >:(
0x70db38
Get out >:(

they seem to be the same distance apart.

10.)
80

11.)
The message is from the destructor working, meanwhile the byte size is different due to it removing the bytes associated with the deleted arrays.
